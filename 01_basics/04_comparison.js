//console.log(null ==0);
//console.log(null >=0); 
             // comparison convert null into number 0 and thats why null is equal to 0 and the output is true !!
//console.log(undefined >0);
//console.log(undefined ==0);
//console.log(undefined >=0);
            // comparison convert undefined into NaN and thats why undefined is not equal to 0 and the output is false !!
// === is used to compare the value and the type of the value
console.log(2 === "2"); 
 // === strictly checks the comparison nd thats why in above case we cannot compare two different types of datatypes and thats why output will be false
